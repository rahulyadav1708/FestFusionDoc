            <h1>Terms and Conditions------</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the fuel-tastic world of TurboFuel! We're thrilled to have you on board. But before we rev up those
        engines, let's dive into some terms and conditions that are as smooth as our premium fuel:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fueling Up: When you hit that order button, get ready to fill 'er up! We'll deliver your fuel faster than
            you can say "vroom vroom." Just make sure there's someone around to accept the delivery - our drivers don't
            do stand-up comedy...yet.</li>
                <li>Smooth Riding: We promise to keep your fuel delivery experience as smooth as a freshly paved highway.
            However, if there's a pothole along the way (metaphorically speaking), don't worry - we'll fill it up faster
            than you can say "oops."</li>
                <li>Fueling Around: While we're all for a good time, please don't use our fuel for anything other than powering
            vehicles. We don't endorse using it to roast marshmallows or power your jetpack (though we'd love to see
            that). </li>
                <li>No Pumping the Brakes: Once you've placed your order, there's no turning back. Consider it a commitment,
            like getting a tattoo of your favorite car model - but without the regret (hopefully).</li>
                <li>Fuel for Thought: We value your privacy like a secret stash of vintage car parts. Your personal information
            stays with us, locked away tighter than a race car driver's grip on the steering wheel. </li>
                <li>Fueling the Future: We reserve the right to update these terms and conditions as often as you hit the gas
            pedal. So keep an eye out for any changes - they might be as thrilling as a surprise upgrade to turbocharged
            fuel.</li>
                <li>By using TurboFuel, you agree to these terms and conditions faster than a drag racer hits the finish line.
            Now, let's hit the road and fuel up some adventures! </li>
            </ul>
